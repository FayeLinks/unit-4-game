Gem Collection Game Version 1.0 Updated: 7/3/2019

I themed this game off the Lord of the Rings and I used aspects of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to create it! 

The user, a humble Dwarf of Moria, must travel deep into their mountain home to mine the valuable treasures within. While they are filling their mining cart with gold and precious gems, they must be aware of their total load weight. This is because the bridges that span the vast canyons are only able to support a certain amount of weight or they will collapse!

I struggled with the getting the numbers to add up without concatenating, but I looked at several references online and I was able to figure it out after a few attempts.
